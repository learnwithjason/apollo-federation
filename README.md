  What is Apollo Federation? (with Alex Banks) 
</h1>
<h3 align="center">
  This app was built live on <em>Learn With Jason</em> and it was super fun and I’m sad you weren’t there.
</h3>
<p align="center">
  But don’t worry! You can still: 
  <a href="https://www.learnwithjason.dev/what-is-apollo-federation"><strong>watch the video</strong></a> · 
  <!-- <a href="https://demo name.netlify.app"><strong>see the demo</strong></a> ·  -->
  <a href="https://jason.af/lwj/schedule"><strong>see upcoming episodes</strong></a>
</p>

Do you have multiple data sources in your org? Apollo Federation promises to unify your data in a single GraphQL API. Alex Banks teaches us what it is, how it works & how you can use it!
